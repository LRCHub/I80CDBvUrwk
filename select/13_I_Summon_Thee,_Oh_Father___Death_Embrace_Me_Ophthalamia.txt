I sit in loneliness and watch the meaning of my past.
It dances and twitches then it lays down and dies.
I see the morning sky tremble and then it open and begin to cry
As night falls and darkness fills my room... whispering thoughts
Haunt
Me,
My candle burns low.
Can I find my fate? Can I be one with my desire?
The perchment of my future burns fast and I burn myself
Badly in my futile attempt to save it.
The black blood of my heart weeps, in every tear a part of
Myself.
I have features of youth but a soul of age.
Why can't I see the web of lies my life is based upon so I can
Cut
Them
And become one with the sky? I long for the harmony... the
Peace
Within me.
I wish to see myself in the burning light of truth and no longer
Be a
Victim of hate.
I search for the purity in me... I search in my blood...
I open my vein to see what ever it may be.
And as the red rivers of my life flow from its tunnels and
Caves...
I see lies and falseness die.
I'm fading away, drowing in a thick mist of burning ice.
I'm showered in the blood of dying hate and I feel pure.
I'm taken to the breast of my truth and I'm reborn.
