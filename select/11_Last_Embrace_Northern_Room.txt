I'm torn in two, an ordinary man I count my seconds by the hand
She's torn in two, her sun and moon is levitating out of sight again

Over and over we turn back time, then over and over we save your life
It's hard to remember to hide your eyes, you tell me you need me then say goodbye

Don't believe them while you're healing, there's a reason for this feeling
Don't believe them while you're healing, there's a reason for this feeling of desire

Over and over we turn back time, then over and over we save your life
It's hard to remember to hide your eyes, you tell me you need me then say goodbye

I'm torn in two, an ordinary man I count my seconds by the hand
She's torn in two, her sun and moon is levitating out of sight again
I'm torn in two...

(And here we are)
