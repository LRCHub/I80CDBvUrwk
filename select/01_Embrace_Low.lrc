[00:48.14] Holding my head for the last of the race
[01:07.30] Pushing my body to get that embrace
[01:24.80] 
[01:24.79] It won't last
[01:34.69] Hold on fast
[01:44.27] It won't last
[01:53.67] Hold on fast
[01:59.67] 
[02:04.84] Breathing in time, so hard to trace
[02:23.65] Crushing your skull with my warming embrace
[02:45.15] 
[02:40.74] It won't last
[02:50.32] Hold on fast
[02:59.77] It won't last
[03:09.29] Hold on fast
[03:15.29] 
[03:19.10] I fell down the stairs
[03:28.54] I wished I were dead
[03:38.21] You ran for the light
[03:47.48] He handed me your head
[03:55.97] It won't last
[04:02.47] 
[04:05.88] It won't last
[04:15.48] Hold on fast
[04:25.13] It won't last
[04:34.80] Hold on fast
