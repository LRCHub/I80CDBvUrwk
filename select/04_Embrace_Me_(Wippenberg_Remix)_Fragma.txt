You broke my resistance
And you tore the curtains down
I hardly seem to miss them
Since you tossed them to the ground
And I tried to resist I just cannot exist without your love
You're offering me assistance
For a mind that's spinning 'round
And I try to be strong I just cannot go on without your love
Embrace me - run your fingers through my hair
Embrace me - let me feel you everywhere
And when you face me - I see heaven in your smile
Now that look in your eyes and the sound of your sighs
Will make my life worthwhile
Just like a dream that's never ending
I'm so happy to give in
There's no need to complain 'cause it's all just in vain without your love
A broken heart in need of mending
And a game that both of us will win
Don't you take it away 'cause I really can't play without your love
Embrace me - run your fingers through my hair
Embrace me - let me feel you everywhere
And when you face me - I see heaven in your smile
Now that look in your eyes and the sound of your sighs
Will make my life worthwhile
Make me understand
Let me hold your hand
This is how it's planed
Let me feel you oh
Everywhere
Embrace me - run your fingers through my hair
Embrace me - let me feel you everywhere
And when you face me - I see heaven in your smile
Now the taste of your kiss is the taste I can't miss
And it makes my life worthwhile
