My heart is pounding
Unrealistic move
Slack and retarded
Like you

Forcing me into this
Pathetic deed

My heart is pounding
Untrue

Run and be lost
Flee and it costs
Take and you'll pay
That's where I lay

My heart is pounding
Unexpected move
Back where I started
With you

Forcing me into this
Pathetic deed

My heart is pounding
Untrue
